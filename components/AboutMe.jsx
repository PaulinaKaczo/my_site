                    <p>I graduated from the University Science and Technology in Cracow in the field of Geodesy and Cartography. In college, I was dealing with programming, but only in recent years have I become more interested in it. I have recently completed a comprehensive course in frontend development, where I gained a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS, Sass and JavaScript. As a freelancer, I have had the opportunity to apply my skills to real-world projects, working closely with clients to deliver high-quality and visually appealing websites. I thrive in dynamic environments that encourage creativity and innovation, and I am always excited to explore new technologies and frameworks. With a strong attention to detail and a problem-solving mindset, I am committed to delivering user-friendly and responsive web experiences. I am now seeking opportunities to contribute my skills and expand my knowledge as part of a collaborative and growth-oriented team.</p>
